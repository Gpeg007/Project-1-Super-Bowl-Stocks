# Project-1-Super-Bowl-Stocks

Created a program that takes in stock information the week before the 2019 superbowl and compared it to the same stocks a week later.

This was an attempt to determine if advertisements played during the superbowl had a
significant effect on the stock prices of the companies that the ads are for.

This project utilizes Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib.

We first used Python to extract our data from csv files and place into a Pandas database.

Then, we used MatPlotLib to display the trends and differences in stock prices before and after the superbowl.

We found that companies advertizing their products saw a significant increase in their stock prices (budweizer, doritos, etc.), 
while companies advertizing their services or platforms (car insurance, amazon, etc.) saw no significant change.
